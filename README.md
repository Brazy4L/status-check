This tool allows you to test whether a certain website is accessible or not. It has a predefined list of websites that you can customize to your liking by adding or removing a particular website. In turn, the list is being saved and updated in your browser's cache. All the testing is being performed locally in a browser, and data does not leave your device. Due to these limitations, the tests rely on http request with no-cors mode. If a response is received, the website is considered accessible, otherwise not. These tests can be inaccurate, and they vary based on the server status of a website, your ISP and its censoring techniques, your network settings, device and connection.
